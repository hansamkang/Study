prophetic private in the life guards had heralded the sublime
appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the
swallowing up of london and westminster  even the cocklane

smoothness down hill making paper money and spending it

which passed within his view at a distance of some fifty or
sixty yards  it is likely enough that rooted in the woods of
france and norway there were growing trees when that sufferer
was put to death already marked by the woodman fate to come
down and be sawn into boards to make a certain movable framework
with a sack and a knife in it terrible in history  it is likely
enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy
lands adjacent to paris there were sheltered from the weather

about by pigs and roosted in by poultry which the farmer death
had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the revolution
but that woodman and that farmer though they work unceasingly
work silently and no one heard them as they went about with
muffled tread  the rather forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake was to be atheistical and traitorous

in england there was scarcely an amount of order and protection
to justify much national boasting  daring burglaries by armed
men and highway robberies took place in the capital itself

town without removing their furniture to upholsterers warehouses
for security the highwayman in the dark was a city tradesman in

got shot dead himself by the other four in consequence of the

wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmers boy of sixpence

and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred

farmer worked unheeded those two of the large jaws and those
other two of the plain and the fair faces trod with stir enough
and carried their divine rights with a high hand  thus did the

greatnesses and myriads of small creaturesthe creatures of this
chronicle among the restalong the roads that lay before them



ii

the mail


it was the dover road that lay on a friday night late in november
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business
the dover road lay as to him beyond the dover mail as it lumbered
up shooters hill  he walked up hill in the mire by the side of the
mail as the rest of the passengers did not because they had the
least relish for walking exercise under the circumstances but
because the hill and the harness and the mud and the mail were
all so heavy that the horses had three times already come to a stop
besides once drawing the coach across the road with the mutinous
intent of taking it back to blackheath  reins and whip and coachman
and guard however in combination had read that article of war
which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument
that some brute animals are endued with reason and the team had
capitulated and returned to their duty

with drooping heads and tremulous tails they mashed their way
through the thick mud floundering and stumbling between whiles
as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints  as often
as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand with a
wary woho sohothen the near leader violently shook his
head and everything upon itlike an unusually emphatic horse
denying that the coach could be got up the hill  whenever the
leader made this rattle the passenger started as a nervous
passenger might and was disturbed in mind

there was a steaming mist in all the hollows and it had roamed
in its forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit seeking rest
and finding none  a clammy and intensely cold mist it made its
slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and
overspread one another as the waves of an unwholesome sea might
do  it was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of
the coachlamps but these its own workings and a few yards of
road and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it as if
they had made it all

two other passengers besides the one were plodding up the hill
by the side of the mail  all three were wrapped to the cheekbones
and over the ears and wore jackboots  not one of the three
could have said from anything he saw what either of the other
two was like and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers
from the eyes of the mind as from the eyes of the body of his
two companions  in those days travellers were very shy of being
confidential on a short notice for anybody on the road might be
a robber or in league with robbers  as to the latter when every
postinghouse and alehouse could produce somebody in the captains
pay ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable nondescript
it was the likeliest thing upon the cards  so the guard of the
dover mail thought to himself that friday night in november one
thousand seven hundred and seventyfive lumbering up shooters
hill as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail
beating his feet and keeping an eye and a hand on the armchest
before him where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or
eight loaded horsepistols deposited on a substratum of cutlass

the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard
suspected the passengers the passengers suspected one another
and the guard they all suspected everybody else and the coachman
was sure of nothing but the horses as to which cattle he could
with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two testaments
that they were not fit for the journey

woho said the coachman  so then  one more pull and youre
at the top and be damned to you for i have had trouble enough to
get you to itjoe

halloa the guard replied

what oclock do you make it joe

ten minutes good past eleven

my blood ejaculated the vexed coachman and not atop of
shooters yet  tst  yah  get on with you

the emphatic horse cut short by the whip in a most decided
negative made a decided scramble for it and the three other
horses followed suit  once more the dover mail struggled on
with the jackboots of its passengers squashing along by its
side  they had stopped when the coach stopped and they kept
close company with it  if any one of the three had had the
hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into
the mist and darkness he would have put himself in a fair way
of getting shot instantly as a highwayman

the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill
the horses stopped to breathe again and the guard got down to
skid the wheel for the descent and open the coachdoor to let
the passengers in

tst  joe cried the coachman in a warning voice looking down
from his box

what do you say tom

they both listened

i say a horse at a canter coming up joe

i say a horse at a gallop tom returned the guard leaving
his hold of the door and mounting nimbly to his place
gentlemen  in the kings name all of you

with this hurried adjuration he cocked his blunderbuss and
stood on the offensive

the passenger booked by this history was on the coachstep
getting in the two other passengers were close behind him and
about to follow  he remained on the step half in the coach and
half out of they remained in the road below him  they all
looked from the coachman to the guard and from the guard to the
coachman and listened  the coachman looked back and the guard
looked back and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and
looked back without contradicting

the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and
labouring of the coach added to the stillness of the night made
it very quiet indeed  the panting of the horses communicated a
tremulous motion to the coach as if it were in a state of
agitation  the hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps
to be heard but at any rate the quiet pause was audibly
expressive of people out of breath and holding the breath and
having the pulses quickened by expectation

the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill

soho the guard sang out as loud as he could roar  yo there
stand  i shall fire

the pace was suddenly checked and with much splashing and floundering
a mans voice called from the mist is that the dover mail

never you mind what it is the guard retorted  what are you

is that the dover mail

why do you want to know

i want a passenger if it is

what passenger

mr jarvis lorry

our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name
the guard the coachman and the two other passengers eyed him
distrustfully

keep where you are the guard called to the voice in the mist
because if i should make a mistake it could never be set right
in your lifetime  gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight

what is the matter asked the passenger then with mildly
quavering speech  who wants me  is it jerry

i dont like jerrys voice if it is jerry growled the guard
to himself  hes hoarser than suits me is jerry

yes mr lorry

what is the matter

a despatch sent after you from over yonder  t and co

i know this messenger guard said mr lorry getting down into
the roadassisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the
other two passengers who immediately scrambled into the coach
shut the door and pulled up the window  he may come close
theres nothing wrong

i hope there aint but i cant make so nation sure of that
said the guard in gruff soliloquy  hallo you

well  and hallo you said jerry more hoarsely than before

come on at a footpace dye mind me  and if youve got holsters
to that saddle o yourn dont let me see your hand go nigh em
for im a devil at a quick mistake and when i make one it takes
the form of lead  so now lets look at you

the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying
mist and came to the side of the mail where the passenger stood
the rider stooped and casting up his eyes at the guard handed
the passenger a small folded paper  the riders horse was blown
and both horse and rider were covered with mud from the hoofs of
the horse to the hat of the man

guard said the passenger in a tone of quiet business confidence

the watchful guard with his right hand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss his left at the barrel and his eye on the horseman
answered curtly sir

there is nothing to apprehend  i belong to tellsons bank
you must know tellsons bank in london  i am going to paris
on business  a crown to drink  i may read this

if so be as youre quick sir

he opened it in the light of the coachlamp on that side
and readfirst to himself and then aloud  wait at dover for
mamselle its not long you see guard  jerry say that my
answer was recalled to life

jerry started in his saddle  thats a blazing strange answer too
said he at his hoarsest

take that message back and they will know that i received this
as well as if i wrote  make the best of your way  good night

with those words the passenger opened the coachdoor and got in
not at all assisted by his fellowpassengers who had
expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots
and were now making a general pretence of being asleep  with no
more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating
any other kind of action

the coach lumbered on again with heavier wreaths of mist closing
round it as it began the descent  the guard soon replaced his
blunderbuss in his armchest and having looked to the rest of its
contents and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore
in his belt looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat in which
there were a few smiths tools a couple of torches and a tinderbox
for he was furnished with that completeness that if the coachlamps
had been blown and stormed out which did occasionally happen he had
only to shut himself up inside keep the flint and steel sparks well
off the straw and get a light with tolerable safety and ease if he
were lucky in five minutes

tom softly over the coach roof

hallo joe

did you hear the message

i did joe

what did you make of it tom

nothing at all joe

thats a coincidence too the guard mused for i made the
same of it myself

jerry left alone in the mist and darkness dismounted meanwhile
not only to ease his spent horse but to wipe the mud from his
face and shake the wet out of his hatbrim which might be
capable of holding about half a gallon  after standing with the
bridle over his heavilysplashed arm until the wheels of the
mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still
again he turned to walk down the hill

after that there gallop from temple bar old lady i wont trust
your forelegs till i get you on the level said this hoarse
messenger glancing at his mare  recalled to life  thats a
blazing strange message  much of that wouldnt do for you jerry
i say jerry  youd be in a blazing bad way if recalling to life
was to come into fashion jerry

the night shadows


a wonderful fact to reflect upon that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other
a solemn consideration when i enter a great city by night that
every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret
that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret that
every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there
is in some of its imaginings a secret to the heart nearest it
something of the awfulness even of death itself is referable to
this  no more can i turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved
and vainly hope in time to read it all  no more can i look into the
depths of this unfathomable water wherein as momentary lights
glanced into it i have had glimpses of buried treasure and other
things submerged  it was appointed that the book should shut with
a spring for ever and for ever when i had read but a page  it was
appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost when
the light was playing on its surface and i stood in ignorance on the
shore  my friend is dead my neighbour is dead my love the darling
of my soul is dead it is the inexorable consolidation and
perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality
and which i shall carry in mine to my lifes end  in any of the
burialplaces of this city through which i pass is there a sleeper
more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are in their innermost
personality to me or than i am to them

as to this his natural and not to be alienated inheritance
the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as
the king the first minister of state or the richest merchant
in london  so with the three passengers shut up in the narrow
compass of one lumbering old mail coach they were mysteries to
one another as complete as if each had been in his own coach and
six or his own coach and sixty with the breadth of a county
between him and the next

the messenger rode back at an easy trot stopping pretty often at
alehouses by the way to drink but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes  he had eyes
that assorted very well with that decoration being of a surface
black with no depth in the colour or form and much too near
togetheras if they were afraid of being found out in something
singly if they kept too far apart  they had a sinister expression
under an old cockedhat like a threecornered spittoon and over a
great muffler for the chin and throat which descended nearly to the
wearers knees  when he stopped for drink he moved this muffler
with his left hand only while he poured his liquor in with his
right as soon as that was done he muffled again

no jerry no said the messenger harping on one theme as he rode
it wouldnt do for you jerry  jerry you honest tradesman it
wouldnt suit your line of business  recalled  bust me if i
dont think hed been a drinking

his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain
several times to take off his hat to scratch his head  except on
the crown which was raggedly bald he had stiff black hair
standing jaggedly all over it and growing down hill almost to his
broad blunt nose  it was so like smiths work so much more like
the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair that the best
of players at leapfrog might have declined him as the most
dangerous man in the world to go over

while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
watchman in his box at the door of tellsons bank by temple bar who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message and took
such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of
uneasiness  they seemed to be numerous for she shied at every
shadow on the road

what time the mailcoach lumbered jolted rattled and bumped upon
its tedious way with its three fellowinscrutables inside  to whom
likewise the shadows of the night revealed themselves in the forms
their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested

tellsons bank had a run upon it in the mail  as the bank passenger
with an arm drawn through the leathern strap which did what lay in
it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger and driving
him into his corner whenever the coach got a special joltnodded in
his place with halfshut eyes the little coachwindows and the
coachlamp dimly gleaming through them and the bulky bundle of
opposite passenger became the bank and did a great stroke of business
the rattle of the harness was the chink of money and more drafts
were honoured in five minutes than even tellsons with all its
foreign and home connection ever paid in thrice the time  then the
strongrooms underground at tellsons with such of their valuable
stores and secrets as were known to the passenger and it was not a
little that he knew about them opened before him and he went in
among them with the great keys and the feeblyburning candle and
found them safe and strong and sound and still just as he had
last seen them

but though the bank was almost always with him and though the coach
in a confused way like the presence of pain under an opiate was
always with him there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run all through the night  he was on his way to dig some
one out of a grave

now which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before
him was the true face of the buried person the shadows of the night
did not indicate but they were all the faces of a man of fiveand
forty by years and they differed principally in the passions they
expressed and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state
pride contempt defiance stubbornness submission lamentation
succeeded one another so did varieties of sunken cheek cadaverous
colour emaciated hands and figures  but the face was in the main
one face and every head was prematurely white  a hundred times the
dozing passenger inquired of this spectre

buried how long

the answer was always the same  almost eighteen years

you had abandoned all hope of being dug out

long ago

you know that you are recalled to life

they tell me so

i hope you care to live

i cant say

shall i show her to you  will you come and see her

the answers to this question were various and contradictory
sometimes the broken reply was wait  it would kill me if i saw
her too soon  sometimes it was given in a tender rain of tears
and then it was take me to her  sometimes it was staring and
bewildered and then it was i dont know her  i dont understand

after such imaginary discourse the passenger in his fancy would dig
and dig dignow with a spade now with a great key now with his
handsto dig this wretched creature out  got out at last with
earth hanging about his face and hair he would suddenly fan away to
dust  the passenger would then start to himself and lower the
window to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek

yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain on the
moving patch of light from the lamps and the hedge at the roadside
retreating by jerks the night shadows outside the coach would fall
into the train of the night shadows within  the real bankinghouse
by temple bar the real business of the past day the real strong
rooms the real express sent after him and the real message returned
would all be there  out of the midst of them the ghostly face would
rise and he would accost it again

buried how long

almost eighteen years

i hope you care to live

i cant say

digdigdiguntil an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pull up the window draw his arm
securely through the leathern strap and speculate upon the two
slumbering forms until his mind lost its hold of them and they
again slid away into the bank and the grave

buried how long

almost eighteen years

you had abandoned all hope of being dug out

long ago

the words were still in his hearing as just spokendistinctly in his
hearing as ever spoken words had been in his lifewhen the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight and found that
the shadows of the night were gone

he lowered the window and looked out at the rising sun  there was a
ridge of ploughed land with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked beyond a quiet coppicewood
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees  though the earth was cold and wet the sky was
clear and the sun rose bright placid and beautiful

eighteen years said the passenger looking at the sun
gracious creator of day  to be buried alive for eighteen years



iv

the preparation


when the mail got successfully to dover in the course of the
forenoon the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened the
coachdoor as his custom was  he did it with some flourish of
ceremony for a mail journey from london in winter was an achievement
to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon

by that time there was only one adventurous traveller left be
congratulated  for the two others had been set down at their
respective roadside destinations  the mildewy inside of the coach
with its damp and dirty straw its disagreeable smell and its
obscurity was rather like a larger dogkennel  mr lorry the
passenger shaking himself out of it in chains of straw a tangle of
shaggy wrapper flapping hat and muddy legs was rather like a
larger sort of dog

there will be a packet to calais tomorrow drawer

yes sir if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair
the tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon
sir  bed sir

i shall not go to bed till night but i want a bedroom and a barber

and then breakfast sir yes sir that way sir if you please
show concord  gentlemans valise and hot water to concord pull off
gentlemans boots in concord you will find a fine sea coal fire
sir fetch barber to concord stir about there now for concord

the concord bedchamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
mail and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
head to foot the room had the odd interest for the establishment of
the royal george that although but one kind of man was seen to go
into it all kinds and varieties of men came out of it  consequently
another drawer and two porters and several maids and the landlady
were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between
the concord and the coffeeroom when a gentleman of sixty formally
dressed in a brown suit of clothes pretty well worn but very well
kept with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets passed
along on his way to his breakfast

the coffeeroom had no other occupant that forenoon than the
gentleman in brown  his breakfasttable was drawn before the fire
and as he sat with its light shining on him waiting for the meal
he sat so still that he might have been sitting for his portrait

very orderly and methodical he looked with a hand on each knee and
a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat
as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire  he had a good leg and was a little
vain of it for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close and were
of a fine texture his shoes and buckles too though plain were
trim  he wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig setting very
close to his head  which wig it is to be presumed was made of hair
but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of
silk or glass  his linen though not of a fineness in accordance
with his stockings was as white as the tops of the waves that broke
upon the neighbouring beach or the specks of sail that glinted in
the sunlight far at sea  a face habitually suppressed and quieted
was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright
eyes that it must have cost their owner in years gone by some pains
to drill to the composed and reserved expression of tellsons bank
he had a healthy colour in his cheeks and his face though lined
bore few traces of anxiety  but perhaps the confidential bachelor
clerks in tellsons bank were principally occupied with the cares of
other people and perhaps secondhand cares like secondhand
clothes come easily off and on

completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait
mr lorry dropped off to sleep  the arrival of his breakfast roused
him and he said to the drawer as he moved his chair to it

i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at
any time today  she may ask for mr jarvis lorry or she may only
ask for a gentleman from tellsons bank  please to let me know

yes sir  tellsons bank in london sir

yes

yes sir  we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen
in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris
sir  a vast deal of travelling sir in tellson and companys house

yes  we are quite a french house as well as an english one

yes sir  not much in the habit of such travelling yourself
i think sir

not of late years  it is fifteen years since wesince icame
last from france

indeed sir  that was before my time here sir  before our peoples
time here sir  the george was in other hands at that time sir

i believe so

but i would hold a pretty wager sir that a house like tellson and
company was flourishing a matter of fifty not to speak of fifteen
years ago

you might treble that and say a hundred and fifty yet not be far
from the truth

indeed sir

rounding his mouth and both his eyes as he stepped backward from the
table the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left
dropped into a comfortable attitude and stood surveying the guest
while he ate and drank as from an observatory or watchtower
according to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages

when mr lorry had finished his breakfast he went out for a stroll
on the beach  the little narrow crooked town of dover hid itself
away from the beach and ran its head into the chalk cliffs like a
marine ostrich  the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones
tumbling wildly about and the sea did what it liked and what it
liked was destruction  it thundered at the town and thundered at
the cliffs and brought the coast down madly  the air among the
houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have
supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it as sick people went
down to be dipped in the sea  a little fishing was done in the port
and a quantity of strolling about by night and looking seaward
particularly at those times when the tide made and was near flood
small tradesmen who did no business whatever sometimes unaccountably
realised large fortunes and it was remarkable that nobody in the
neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter

as the day declined into the afternoon and the air which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seen
became again charged with mist and vapour mr lorrys thoughts
seemed to cloud too  when it was dark and he sat before the
coffeeroom fire awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast
his mind was busily digging digging digging in the live red coals

a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals
no harm otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of
work  mr lorry had been idle a long time and had just poured out
his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of
satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a
fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle when a rattling
of wheels came up the narrow street and rumbled into the innyard

he set down his glass untouched  this is mamselle said he

in a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that miss
manette had arrived from london and would be happy to see the
gentleman from tellsons

so soon

miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road and required
none then and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from
tellsons immediately if it suited his pleasure and convenience

the gentleman from tellsons had nothing left for it but to empty his
glass with an air of stolid desperation settle his odd little flaxen
wig at the ears and follow the waiter to miss manettes apartment
it was a large dark room furnished in a funereal manner with black
horsehair and loaded with heavy dark tables  these had been oiled
and oiled until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of
the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf as if they were
buried in deep graves of black mahogany and no light to speak of
could be expected from them until they were dug out

the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr lorry
picking his way over the wellworn turkey carpet supposed
miss manette to be for the moment in some adjacent room until
having got past the two tall candles he saw standing to receive him
by the table between them and the fire a young lady of not more than
seventeen in a ridingcloak and still holding her straw travelling
hat by its ribbon in her hand  as his eyes rested on a short slight
pretty figure a quantity of golden hair a pair of blue eyes that
met his own with an inquiring look and a forehead with a singular
capacity remembering how young and smooth it was of rifting and
knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity
or wonder or alarm or merely of a bright fixed attention though it
included all the four expressionsas his eyes rested on these things
a sudden vivid likeness passed before him of a child whom he had
held in his arms on the passage across that very channel one cold
time when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high  the
likeness passed away like a breath along the surface of the gaunt
pierglass behind her on the frame of which a hospital procession
of negro cupids several headless and all cripples were offering
black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine
genderand he made his formal bow to miss manette

pray take a seat sir  in a very clear and pleasant young voice
a little foreign in its accent but a very little indeed

i kiss your hand miss said mr lorry with the manners of an
earlier date as he made his formal bow again and took his seat

i received a letter from the bank sir yesterday informing me that
some intelligenceor discovery

the word is not material miss either word will do

respecting the small property of my poor father whom i never
sawso long dead

mr lorry moved in his chair and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids  as if they had any help for
anybody in their absurd baskets

rendered it necessary that i should go to paris there to
communicate with a gentleman of the bank so good as to be despatched
to paris for the purpose

myself

as i was prepared to hear sir

she curtseyed to him young ladies made curtseys in those days with
a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and
wiser he was than she  he made her another bow

i replied to the bank sir that as it was considered necessary by
those who know and who are so kind as to advise me that i should go
to france and that as i am an orphan and have no friend who could go
with me i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted to place
myself during the journey under that worthy gentlemans protection
the gentleman had left london but i think a messenger was sent after
him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here

i was happy said mr lorry to be entrusted with the charge
i shall be more happy to execute it

sir i thank you indeed  i thank you very gratefully  it was told
me by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of
the business and that i must prepare myself to find them of a
surprising nature  i have done my best to prepare myself and i
naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are

naturally said mr lorry  yesi

after a pause he added again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears
it is very difficult to begin

he did not begin but in his indecision met her glance  the young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expressionbut it was
pretty and characteristic besides being singularand she raised
her hand as if with an involuntary action she caught at or stayed
some passing shadow

are you quite a stranger to me sir

am i not  mr lorry opened his hands and extended them outwards
with an argumentative smile

between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose the line
of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be the
expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the
chair by which she had hitherto remained standing  he watched her as
she mused and the moment she raised her eyes again went on

in your adopted country i presume i cannot do better than address
you as a young english lady miss manette

if you please sir

miss manette i am a man of business  i have a business charge to
acquit myself of  in your reception of it dont heed me any more
than if i was a speaking machinetruly i am not much else  i will
with your leave relate to you miss the story of one of our
customers

story

he seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated when he
added in a hurry yes customers in the banking business we
usually call our connection our customers  he was a french
gentleman a scientific gentleman a man of great acquirementsa
doctor

not of beauvais

why yes of beauvais  like monsieur manette your father
the gentleman was of beauvais  like monsieur manette your father
the gentleman was of repute in paris  i had the honour of knowing
him there  our relations were business relations but confidential
i was at that time in our french house and had beenoh twenty years

at that timei may ask at what time sir

i speak miss of twenty years ago  he marriedan english
ladyand i was one of the trustees  his affairs like the affairs
of many other french gentlemen and french families were entirely in
tellsons hands  in a similar way i am or i have been trustee of
one kind or other for scores of our customers  these are mere business
relations miss there is no friendship in them no particular
interest nothing like sentiment  i have passed from one to another
in the course of my business life just as i pass from one of our
customers to another in the course of my business day in short i
have no feelings i am a mere machine  to go on

but this is my fathers story sir and i begin to think
the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon himthat
when i was left an orphan through my mothers surviving my father
only two years it was you who brought me to england  i am almost
sure it was you

mr lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
to take his and he put it with some ceremony to his lips  he then
conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again and holding
the chairback with his left hand and using his right by turns to
rub his chin pull his wig at the ears or point what he said stood
looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his

miss manette it was i  and you will see how truly i spoke of
myself just now in saying i had no feelings and that all the
relations i hold with my fellowcreatures are mere business
relations when you reflect that i have never seen you since
no you have been the ward of tellsons house since and i have been
busy with the other business of tellsons house since  feelings
i have no time for them no chance of them  i pass my whole life
miss in turning an immense pecuniary mangle

after this odd description of his daily routine of employment mr
lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands which
was most unnecessary for nothing could be flatter than its shining
surface was before and resumed his former attitude

so far miss as you have remarked this is the story of your
regretted father  now comes the difference  if your father had not
died when he diddont be frightened  how you start

she did indeed start  and she caught his wrist with both her hands

pray said mr lorry in a soothing tone bringing his left hand
from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that
clasped him in so violent a tremble  pray control your agitationa
matter of business  as i was saying

her look so discomposed him that he stopped wandered and began anew

as i was saying if monsieur manette had not died if he had
suddenly and silently disappeared if he had been spirited away
if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place though
no art could trace him if he had an enemy in some compatriot who
could exercise a privilege that i in my own time have known the boldest
people afraid to speak of in a whisper across the water there for
instance the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment
of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time if his
wife had implored the king the queen the court the clergy for any
tidings of him and all quite in vainthen the history of your father
would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman the doctor
of beauvais

i entreat you to tell me more sir

i will  i am going to  you can bear it

i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment

you speak collectedly and youare collected  thats good
though his manner was less satisfied than his words a matter of
business  regard it as a matter of businessbusiness that must be
done  now if this doctors wife though a lady of great courage and
spirit had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little
child was born

the little child was a daughter sir

a daughter  aamatter of businessdont be distressed  miss
if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child
was born that she came to the determination of sparing the poor
child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the
pains of by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead
no dont kneel  in heavens name why should you kneel to me

for the truth  o dear good compassionate sir for the truth

aa matter of business  you confuse me and how can i transact
business if i am confused  let us be clearheaded  if you could
kindly mention now for instance what nine times ninepence are
or how many shillings in twenty guineas it would be so encouraging
i should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind

without directly answering to this appeal she sat so still when
he had very gently raised her and the hands that had not ceased
to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been
that she communicated some reassurance to mr jarvis lorry

thats right thats right  courage  business  you have business
before you useful business  miss manette your mother took this
course with you  and when she diedi believe brokenhearted
having never slackened her unavailing search for your father
she left you at two years old to grow to be blooming beautiful
and happy without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty
whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison or wasted
there through many lingering years

as he said the words he looked down with an admiring pity on the
flowing golden hair as if he pictured to himself that it might have
been already tinged with grey

you know that your parents had no great possession and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you  there has been no
new discovery of money or of any other property but

he felt his wrist held closer and he stopped  the expression in the
forehead which had so particularly attracted his notice and which
was now immovable had deepened into one of pain and horror

but he has beenbeen found  he is alive  greatly changed it is
too probable almost a wreck it is possible though we will hope the
best  still alive  your father has been taken to the house of an
old servant in paris and we are going there  i to identify him if
i can  you to restore him to life love duty rest comfort

a shiver ran through her frame and from it through his  she said
in a low distinct awestricken voice as if she were saying it in a
dream

i am going to see his ghost  it will be his ghostnot him

mr lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm  there there
there  see now see now  the best and the worst are known to you now
you are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman and with a fair
sea voyage and a fair land journey you will be soon at his dear side

she repeated in the same tone sunk to a whisper i have been free
i have been happy yet his ghost has never haunted me

only one thing more said mr lorry laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her attention  he has been found under
another name his own long forgotten or long concealed  it would be
worse than useless now to inquire which worse than useless to seek
to know whether he has been for years overlooked or always designedly
held prisoner  it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries
because it would be dangerous  better not to mention the subject
anywhere or in any way and to remove himfor a while at all events
out of france  even i safe as an englishman and even tellsons
important as they are to french credit avoid all naming of the
matter  i carry about me not a scrap of writing openly referring to
it  this is a secret service altogether  my credentials entries
and memoranda are all comprehended in the one line recalled to
life which may mean anything  but what is the matter  she doesnt
notice a word  miss manette

perfectly still and silent and not even fallen back in her chair
she sat under his hand utterly insensible with her eyes open and
fixed upon him and with that last expression looking as if it were
carved or branded into her forehead  so close was her hold upon his
arm that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her
therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving

a wildlooking woman whom even in his agitation mr lorry observed
to be all of a red colour and to have red hair and to be dressed in
some extraordinary tightfitting fashion and to have on her head a
most wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure and good
measure too or a great stilton cheese came running into the room in
advance of the inn servants and soon settled the question of his
detachment from the poor young lady by laying a brawny hand upon his
chest and sending him flying back against the nearest wall

i really think this must be a man was mr lorrys breathless
reflection simultaneously with his coming against the wall

why look at you all bawled this figure addressing the inn
servants  why dont you go and fetch things instead of standing
there staring at me  i am not so much to look at am i  why dont
you go and fetch things  ill let you know if you dont bring
smellingsalts cold water and vinegar quick i will

there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives and she
softly laid the patient on a sofa and tended her with great skill
and gentleness  calling her my precious and my bird and spreading
her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care

and you in brown she said indignantly turning to mr lorry
couldnt you tell her what you had to tell her without frightening
her to death  look at her with her pretty pale face and her cold
hands  do you call that being a banker

mr lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer that he could only look on at a distance with much feebler
sympathy and humility while the strong woman having banished the
inn servants under the mysterious penalty of letting them know
something not mentioned if they stayed there staring recovered her
charge by a regular series of gradations and coaxed her to lay her
drooping head upon her shoulder

i hope she will do well now said mr lorry

no thanks to you in brown if she does  my darling pretty

i hope said mr lorry after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility that you accompany miss manette to france

a likely thing too replied the strong woman  if it was ever
intended that i should go across salt water do you suppose
providence would have cast my lot in an island

this being another question hard to answer mr jarvis lorry withdrew
to consider it



v

the wineshop


a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken in the street
the accident had happened in getting it out of a cart the cask had
tumbled out with a run the hoops had burst and it lay on the stones
just outside the door of the wineshop shattered like a
walnutshell

all the people within reach had suspended their business or their
idleness to run to the spot and drink the wine  the rough
irregular stones of the street pointing every way and designed
one might have thought expressly to lame all living creatures that
approached them had dammed it into little pools these were surrounded
each by its own jostling group or crowd according to its size
some men kneeled down made scoops of their two hands joined and
sipped or tried to help women who bent over their shoulders to
sip before the wine had all run out between their fingers  others
men and women dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated
earthenware or even with handkerchiefs from womens heads which
were squeezed dry into infants mouths others made small mud
embankments to stem the wine as it ran others directed by
lookerson up at high windows darted here and there to cut off
little streams of wine that started away in new directions others
devoted themselves to the sodden and leedyed pieces of the cask
licking and even champing the moister winerotted fragments with
eager relish  there was no drainage to carry off the wine and not
only did it all get taken up but so much mud got taken up along with
it that there might have been a scavenger in the street if anybody
acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence

a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voicesvoices of men
women and childrenresounded in the street while this wine game
lasted  there was little roughness in the sport and much playfulness
there was a special companionship in it an observable inclination on
the part of every one to join some other one which led especially
among the luckier or lighterhearted to frolicsome embraces
drinking of healths shaking of hands and even joining of hands and
dancing a dozen together  when the wine was gone and the places
where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridironpattern by
fingers these demonstrations ceased as suddenly as they had broken
out  the man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was
cutting set it in motion again the women who had left on a doorstep
the little pot of hot ashes at which she had been trying to soften
the pain in her own starved fingers and toes or in those of her
child returned to it men with bare arms matted locks and cadaverous
faces who had emerged into the winter light from cellars moved
away to descend again and a gloom gathered on the scene that
appeared more natural to it than sunshine

the wine was red wine and had stained the ground of the narrow
street in the suburb of saint antoine in paris where it was
spilled  it had stained many hands too and many faces and many
naked feet and many wooden shoes  the hands of the man who sawed
the wood left red marks on the billets and the forehead of the
woman who nursed her baby was stained with the stain of the old rag
she wound about her head again  those who had been greedy with the
staves of the cask had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth
and one tall joker so besmirched his head more out of a long squalid
bag of a nightcap than in it scrawled upon a wall with his finger
dipped in muddy wineleesblood

the time was to come when that wine too would be spilled on the
streetstones and when the stain of it would be red upon many there

and now that the cloud settled on saint antoine which a momentary
gleam had driven from his sacred countenance the darkness of it was
heavycold dirt sickness ignorance and want were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presencenobles of great power all of them
but most especially the last  samples of a people that had
undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill and
certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young
shivered at every corner passed in and out at every doorway looked
from every window fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the
wind shook  the mill which had worked them down was the mill that
grinds young people old the children had ancient faces and grave
voices and upon them and upon the grown faces and ploughed into
every furrow of age and coming up afresh was the sigh hunger  it
was prevalent everywhere  hunger was pushed out of the tall houses
in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines hunger was
patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper hunger was
repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the
man sawed off hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys and
started up from the filthy street that had no offal among its refuse
of anything to eat  hunger was the inscription on the bakers
shelves written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad
bread at the sausageshop in every deaddog preparation that was
offered for sale  hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder hunger was shred into atomics in
every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato fried with some
reluctant drops of oil

its abiding place was in all things fitted to it  a narrow winding
street full of offence and stench with other narrow winding streets
diverging all peopled by rags and nightcaps and all smelling of
rags and nightcaps and all visible things with a brooding look upon
them that looked ill  in the hunted air of the people there was yet
some wildbeast thought of the possibility of turning at bay  depressed
and slinking though they were eyes of fire were not wanting among
them nor compressed lips white with what they suppressed nor
foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallowsrope they mused
about enduring or inflicting  the trade signs and they were almost
as many as the shops were all grim illustrations of want  the
butcher and the porkman painted up only the leanest scrags of meat
the baker the coarsest of meagre loaves  the people rudely pictured
as drinking in the wineshops croaked over their scanty measures of
thin wine and beer and were gloweringly confidential together
nothing was represented in a flourishing condition save tools and
weapons but the cutlers knives and axes were sharp and bright the
smiths hammers were heavy and the gunmakers stock was murderous
the crippling stones of the pavement with their many little
reservoirs of mud and water had no footways but broke off abruptly
at the doors  the kennel to make amends ran down the middle of the
streetwhen it ran at all  which was only after heavy rains and
then it ran by many eccentric fits into the houses  across the
streets at wide intervals one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley at night when the lamplighter had let these down and lighted
and hoisted them again a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead as if they were at sea  indeed they were at sea
and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest

for the time was to come when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter in their idleness and hunger
so long as to conceive the idea of improving on his method and
hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys to flare upon the
darkness of their condition  but the time was not come yet and
every wind that blew over france shook the rags of the scarecrows
in vain for the birds fine of song and feather took no warning

the wineshop was a corner shop better than most others in its
appearance and degree and the master of the wineshop had stood
outside it in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches looking on at
the struggle for the lost wine  its not my affair said he
with a final shrug of the shoulders  the people from the market
did it  let them bring another

there his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his
joke he called to him across the way

say then my gaspard what do you do there

the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance as is often
the way with his tribe  it missed its mark and completely failed
as is often the way with his tribe too

what now  are you a subject for the mad hospital said the
wineshop keeper crossing the road and obliterating the jest with
a handful of mud picked up for the purpose and smeared over it
why do you write in the public streets  is theretell me thouis
there no other place to write such words in

in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhaps accidentally
perhaps not upon the jokers heart  the joker rapped it with his
own took a nimble spring upward and came down in a fantastic
dancing attitude with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot
into his hand and held out  a joker of an extremely not to say
wolfishly practical character he looked under those circumstances

put it on put it on said the other  call wine wine and finish
there  with that advice he wiped his soiled hand upon the jokers
dress such as it wasquite deliberately as having dirtied the hand
on his account and then recrossed the road and entered the wineshop

this wineshop keeper was a bullnecked martiallooking man of
thirty and he should have been of a hot temperament for although
it was a bitter day he wore no coat but carried one slung over his
shoulder  his shirtsleeves were rolled up too and his brown arms
were bare to the elbows  neither did he wear anything more on his
head than his own crisplycurling short dark hair  he was a dark man
altogether with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them
goodhumoured looking on the whole but implacablelooking too
evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose a man not
desirable to be met rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either
side for nothing would turn the man
